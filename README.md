# Explorer Application

# Overview
Explorer is an application designed to help tourists easily select and purchase tours that match their interests and preferences. Users can actively participate in tours by commenting on their experiences on the blog and communicating with other participants. Additionally, users have access to secret destinations and challenges that the tours offer. For tour creators, the application provides statistical tracking and participant monitoring, along with many other features such as tour selection and purchase based on user preferences, user interaction through blogs, access to secret destinations, and statistical tracking.

### Technologies
Backend: C# with .NET (ASP.NET)
Frontend: Angular
Database: PostgreSQL

### Development Process
The project was carried out using the SCRUM agile methodology. We had four-week sprints and weekly meetings to discuss progress, plans, and problems. We used Trello for task management, allowing easy tracking of the project's progress.

### Stakeholder Involvement
We had several interviews with stakeholders to gather user requirements, discuss potential issues and solutions, and receive feedback on testing the application.

### Presentation
At the end of the project, we presented our application to our peers, professors, and assistants, demonstrating the product's features and benefits.

### Testing
Unit and integration tests were performed to ensure the reliability of each method and component.
Initially, tests were written after completing functionality. Over time, we adopted a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, where tests were written before developing the logic.
Functionality was considered complete once all tests passed successfully.

### Application Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the repository
Set up the backend using .NET (ASP.NET) and C#
Set up the frontend using Angular
Configure the database using pgAdmin
